Exploratory data analysis on US traffic fatality data using BigQuery

## Why this dataset?
This is my first attempt in working on BigQuery and I have decided to use Kaggle for this purpose without having the need to worry about the configurations. I have decided on this dataset as they have numerous interesting attributes that I am interested in understanding. For instance, I am curious on whether any particular month has an effect on traffic accident fatalities. Also, I made my predictions beforehand prior to the analysis and was interested to see if I am right. As I have spent the whole of last month learning SQL, this is a great independent practice to figure things out.

## Dataset
You will not be able to download the dataset directly from Kaggle  but you can still work it through on Kaggle's kernel through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/nhtsa-traffic-fatalities).
